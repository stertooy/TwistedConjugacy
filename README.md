The GAP package TwistedConjugacy
==================================

by Sam Tertooy <sam.tertooy@kuleuven.be>



About
-----

The TwistedConjugacy package provides methods for solving the twisted conjugacy
problem (including the "search" and "multiple" variants) and for computing
Reidemeister classes, numbers, spectra, and zeta functions. It also includes
utility functions for working with (double) cosets, group homomorphisms, and
group derivations.

These methods are primarily designed for use with finite groups and with
PcpGroups (finite or infinite) provided by the Polycyclic package.
    
This package requires GAP version 4.14 or later. The extension for PcpGroups
requires Polycyclic version 2.16 or later.
